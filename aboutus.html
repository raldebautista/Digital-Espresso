        <p id="story"><b>Heritage & History.</b> From it's humble beginnings as a small, boutique seaside café in the breezy Bosphorus Strait, Digital Espresso stood firm to its commitment in delivering coffee with a distinctive quality reflective of its culture and natural environment.
          Sourced locally, the ingredients are a tribute to the legacy of coffeemaking – a legendary backdrop to the interwoven tapestry of style, flavors, and characters resplendent of Mediterranean glamor.
          The success of the first Istanbul café opened back in 2009 proved to exceed expectations, and plans were made to expand across the <b>Mediterranean Sea region.</b>
          Each new café brought about a unique and localized ambience, as the environment and flavors melded into a seamless, deep, and rich character.
          <br><br>
          <b>Expansion.</b> The unprecedented success of Digital Espresso in the early 2010s saw visitors from around the world frequent landmark cafés as though they were tourist spots on their own right.
          It was the perfect storm: an iconic location, elegant ambience, and world-famous coffee that would see us expanding overseas.
          After the success of the Monaco flagship that was loved and frequented by well-heeled jetsetters, Digital Espresso set its sights beyond the breezy shores to the snowy mountains, serving as a warm respite to the frigid backdrop of a winter wonderland.
          Modelled after the famous European street café, we saw well-curated expansion into various urban centers around the globe heading to the 2020s.
          <br><br>
          <b>Legacy.</b> 2023 saw the year that Digital Espresso would open its doors to the Philippines.
          Beyond a rich coffee presence socially and culturally, we sought to capture the energy of an up-and-coming nation keen to explore the flavors of the world – most especially the Mediterranean – in the comforts of their home.
          With three cafés in Manila that have seen year-long operation, alongside 22 well-curated destination addresses around the globe, Digital Espresso is honored in its unwavering mission to give people the taste of international, Mediterranean flavors, at the comfort of home.
          Local character, thoughtfully fused with the flavors of the world, truly bring out the authentic café experience marked with <b>heritage & history.</b></p>
